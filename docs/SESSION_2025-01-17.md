# Session Summary: January 17, 2025

## What We Built

### 1. FishFeels Startup Idea (via /ralph-loop)
Generated a 9.9/10 scored startup idea through 10 iterations:
- **Name:** FishFeels
- **Tagline:** "Fish your feelings. Heal without trying."
- **Concept:** A cozy fishing game that secretly teaches mental health coping skills through gameplay
- **Key Innovation:** Passive emotional detection via gameplay patterns, social "pond rescue" mechanics
- **Business Model:** Consumer subscription + B2B enterprise wellness + insurance reimbursement
- **Viral Mechanics:** Pond rescue missions, fish breeding with friends, emotional genome yearly recap

### 2. Detailed PRD Generation System
Added three PRD levels with fun naming:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Quick | `napkin` | ~10 sections, quick sketch |
| Full | `science-fair` | 18 sections, 15-20 user stories, full architecture |
| Complete | `genius` | Everything + structured JSON output |

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/ralph/types.ts` - Added PRD types (DetailedPRD, UserPersona, UserStory, FeatureSpec, etc.)
- `src/lib/ralph/prompts.ts` - Added detailed PRD prompt templates
- `src/lib/ralph/engine.ts` - Added `generateDetailedPRD()`, `generateDetailedPRDJson()`, `generatePRDByLevel()`
- `src/routes/api/prd/generate/+server.ts` - Updated to support level parameter

### 3. Claude Code Plugin Structure
Created plugin files for marketplace distribution:

```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── ralph-loop.md    # Iterative idea generation (9.9+ threshold)
│   └── ralph-prd.md     # PRD generation with levels
└── settings.json        # Plugin manifest
```

## Git Commits
1. `5eefcf4` - feat: Add detailed PRD generation with 3 levels + Claude Code plugin
2. `b1b6927` - style: Rename PRD levels to napkin/science-fair/genius

## Strategic Decisions

### Plugin-First Strategy
- Focus on CLI plugin experience, not website sync
- Ideas stay private in user's local environment
- Website becomes funnel TO the plugin, not replacement

### PRD Naming
- Rejected: basic/detailed/enterprise (too corporate)
- Rejected: valedictorian (not globally understood)
- Accepted: napkin/science-fair/genius (fun, universal, fits Ralph energy)

### Viral Mechanics (Deferred)
User noted: People won't want their ideas public. Viral features need rethinking.
- Roast My Idea - rejected (exposes ideas)
- Leaderboard - rejected (same)
- To revisit: find viral hook that respects idea privacy

## Plugin Status

### /ralph-loop
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Tested:** Yes - generated FishFeels idea successfully
- **Usage:** `/ralph-loop "Your idea prompt" --max-iterations 30`

### /ralph-prd
- **Status:** NEEDS TESTING
- **Issue:** Skill invocation failed with "Unknown skill"
- **Likely cause:** Command not registered as a Skill, needs to be invoked differently
- **Workaround:** Use the API endpoint directly or invoke the prompt manually

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/prd/generate
```json
{
  "idea": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "pmfScores": {
    "marketSize": 0-10,
    "problemSeverity": 0-10,
    "solutionFit": 0-10,
    "competition": 0-10,
    "vibeCodeable": 0-10,
    "virality": 0-10
  },
  "level": "napkin" | "science-fair" | "genius",
  "iterations": [{ "content", "dopeLevel", "feedback" }] // optional
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix /ralph-prd command invocation
2. Test PRD generation end-to-end
3. Consider website viral mechanics that respect privacy
4. Deploy and test on production
